Our mission is to develop innovative tools and technologies that drive progress in machine intelligence, empower researchers, and enhance student learning. The lab provides a platform for interdisciplinary collaboration, enabling researchers to explore the vast potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Through these efforts, we aim to deliver meaningful advancements that improve lives, transform industries, and contribute to societal progress.

In the area of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, the lab focuses on building tools and models that enhance communication and understanding. Current projects include AI alignment to ensure ethical AI development, processing Bangladeshi regional dialects, and conducting Bangla sentiment analysis and lemmatization. Additionally, we work on financial sentiment analysis, multilingual applications, NLP for SEC filings, and information retrieval systems to address complex language and data challenges.

In **Computer Vision**, our research leverages the power of visual data to solve practical problems across various sectors. The lab is working on 3D object detection, model compression, and automated body shape measurement for industries like healthcare and fashion. Other projects include automatic license plate recognition, Bangla sign language interpretation, biometric authentication, hand sign recognition, and agricultural innovations like leaf disease prediction. These solutions aim to improve accessibility, security, and efficiency across domains.

The lab’s **Machine Learning** research addresses critical societal challenges while fostering innovation in diverse fields. Current initiatives include predictive models for depression and oral health, time-series forecasting, and early detection of Alzheimer’s disease. We also focus on learning disorders in pediatrics, Bangla handwriting recognition, optical character recognition (OCR), and multi-domain machine learning projects. These efforts aim to deliver real-world impact through intelligent, data-driven systems.

As part of North South University, the Machine Intelligence Lab is committed to becoming a center of excellence in research and innovation. By fostering collaboration among students, faculty, and industry leaders, the lab aims to cultivate a thriving ecosystem of learning and discovery. Our vision is to push the boundaries of machine intelligence and inspire transformative advancements for a better future.

Whether you are a student eager to dive into research, a faculty member seeking collaboration, or an industry partner interested in leveraging cutting-edge solutions, the Machine Intelligence Lab welcomes you. Together, we can explore the vast possibilities of intelligent systems and shape a smarter, more inclusive world.
